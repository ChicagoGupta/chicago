### Peace Projex

Collaborated with K-12 teachers around the world on an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange handwritten letters with school children in a neighboring country. This was done by developing lesson plans for English teachers to use in K-12 classroom settings.  [The project](https://www.facebook.com/walnutedu/posts/2436345716437948) was with K-12 students from Walnut School (Pune, India) and NJV School (Karachi, Pakistan). Special thanks to [Uzair Qarni](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/uqarni?) from Nativ Learning for being an early collaborator for this project.
