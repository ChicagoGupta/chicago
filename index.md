### NoD Coworking

I am the Founder of NoD Coworking which is based in Dallas, Texas. You can usually find me there on Saturdays co-hosting the [Code Collective](https://twitter.com/TexasCode) meetup.

### Love Thy Neighbor

I started an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange letters of peace and friendship with school children in a neighboring country. The project began with India and Pakistan in mind, and then expanded into several other pairs of neighboring countries (United States and Mexico, Thailand and Cambodia, Italy and Switzerland, France and Germany, Denmark and Sweden, Israel and Palestine, Russia and China, Nicaragua and Honduras, Argentina and Chile).

### Percussion

I have been studying percussion since 2001. I studied marching percussion and latin percussion under Josh Schusterman and studied jazz drumset under Brett Deptula. I co-own a recording studio in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood where I record drum tracks for professional musicians and work on experimental projects with local musicians ranging from hip-hop to alternative rock. In the summer and fall seasons I serve as a guest instructor for the South Oak Cliff High School Drumline.
