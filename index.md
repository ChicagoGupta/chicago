### Percussion + Music

I started studying music in 2001 as a percussionist in the school concert band, and then went on to march center snare in the high school drumline and played lead parts in high school and college percussion ensembles (including snare drum, drumset, marimba, timpani, steel drums, djembe, congas). I studied marching percussion and latin percussion under Josh Schusterman from 2002 to 2008, and studied jazz/drumset under Brett Deptula from 2010-2012. I have performed professionally in various ensembles in various settings and began teaching in 2018. I am the in-house drummer for a recording studio in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood where I record drum tracks for professional musicians and work on experimental projects with local musicians ranging from hip-hop to alternative rock. In the summer and fall I serve as a guest instructor for various area high school drumlines including The Greenhill School, South Oak Cliff High School, Plano East Senior High School, and I teach private drumset lessons at the Rockwall School of Music. 

### Northwestern Club of DFW

I am the 2019-2020 President of the Northwestern Alumni Club of Dallas - Fort Worth. I graduated from Northwestern University in 2012 (McCormick/Medill/AyersCCI) and have been on the board of the club since 2014.

### Love Thy Neighbor

I started an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange handwritten letters with school children in a neighboring country. [The project](https://www.facebook.com/walnutedu/posts/2436345716437948) began in 2019 with Walnut School (Pune, India) and NJV School (Karachi, Pakistan).
