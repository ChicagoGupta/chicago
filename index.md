### Percussion + Music

I started studying music in the school concert band, and also was occasionally selected to play with the school choir and orchestra. My teachers were Don Kitchens, [Lori Peel](https://www.turrentinejacksonmorrow.com/obituaries/lori-peel-42317), Josh Schusterman, Christopher Vigneron, LaRae Baker Duff, Glenn Lambert, James Hannah, Matthew Weyer, Brett Deptula, Chris E (guitar), Holly Pyle (voice) [@herjerper](https://www.tiktok.com/@herjerper?), and Justin Copeland (trumpet). I have been co-hosting open jam sessions with professional musicians for many years, and these are some of the artists that I have collaborated with:

### Love Thy Neighbor

In 2019 I collaborated with K-12 teachers around the world on an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange handwritten letters with school children in a neighboring country. This was done by developing lesson plans for English teachers to use in K-12 classroom settings.  [The project](https://www.facebook.com/walnutedu/posts/2436345716437948) was with K-12 students from Walnut School (Pune, India) and NJV School (Karachi, Pakistan). Special thanks to [Uzair Qarni](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/uqarni?) from Nativ Learning for being an early collaborator for this project.
