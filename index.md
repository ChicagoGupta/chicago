### Percussion + Music

I started studying music in 2001 as a percussionist in the school concert band, and also was occasionally selected to play with the school choir and orchestra. My teachers early on were Don Kitchens, [Lori Peel](https://www.turrentinejacksonmorrow.com/obituaries/lori-peel-42317), Josh Schusterman, Christopher Vigneron, LaRae Baker Duff, Glenn Lambert, James Hannah, and Matthew Weyer. Later on I studied New Orleans jazz and composition under Brett Deptula at Northwestern University. More recently, I began studying guitar with Chris from [Ruff Wizard](https://www.ruffwizard.com/) and voice with [@herjerper](https://www.tiktok.com/@herjerper?) and trumpet with [Justin Copeland](http://justincopelandmusic.com/. I have been co-hosting open jam sessions with professional musicians for many years, and through those jam sessions some artists/bands that I have collaborated with include

Book: Writing an instructional book for beginners called "Your 1st 100 Days of Drumming" inspired by my classroom teaching experience, private lesson students, philosophy which argues that the act of practicing music should be an act of creating music. Please contact me if you would like to collaborate with me on this book. Percussion book authors I like to use in the classroom include: Darien Brown (Rudimental Chemistry), Tommy Igoe (Drumset), Ted Reed (Syncopation), George Lawrence Stone (Stick Control), and Mark Wessels (Snare Drum).

### Love Thy Neighbor

In 2019 I collaborated with K-12 teachers around the world on an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange handwritten letters with school children in a neighboring country. This was done by developing lesson plans for English teachers to use in K-12 classroom settings.  [The project](https://www.facebook.com/walnutedu/posts/2436345716437948) was with K-12 students from Walnut School (Pune, India) and NJV School (Karachi, Pakistan). Special thanks to [Uzair Qarni](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/uqarni?) from Nativ Learning for being an early collaborator for this project.
