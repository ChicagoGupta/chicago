### Percussion + Music

I started studying music in 2001 as a percussionist in the school concert band, and then went on to march center snare in the high school drumline and played lead parts in high school and college percussion ensembles (including snare drum, drumset, marimba, timpani, steel drums, djembe, congas). I studied marching percussion and latin percussion under Josh Schusterman from 2002 to 2008, and studied jazz/drumset under Brett Deptula from 2010-2012. I have performed professionally in various ensembles in various settings and began teaching in 2018. For two years, I was the in-house drummer for an independent recording studio in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood where I built a small community by hosting weekly jam sessions, and recorded drum tracks for professional musicians with styles including blues, hip-hop, and alternative rock. In 2019, I briefly was the drummer for a local band called The Secondary Colours led by singer songwriter Aegis Vaughn Brown. In the summer and fall I serve as an adjunct percussion director and/or drumline tech for various area high school drumlines including The Greenhill School, South Oak Cliff High School, Plano East Senior High School, and I teach private lessons via Facetime or Zoom (contact me for details/pricing!). Currently working on an instructional book for beginner percussionists with the working title of "Your 1st 100 Days of Drumming".

### Northwestern Club of DFW

I am the 2019-2020 President of the Northwestern Alumni Club of Dallas - Fort Worth. I graduated from Northwestern University in 2012 (McCormick/Medill/AyersCCI) and have been on the board of the club since 2014.

### Love Thy Neighbor

In 2019 I did an international peace project called Love Thy Neighbor where school children exchange handwritten letters with school children in a neighboring country. [The project](https://www.facebook.com/walnutedu/posts/2436345716437948) was with K-12 students from Walnut School (Pune, India) and NJV School (Karachi, Pakistan).
